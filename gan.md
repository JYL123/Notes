[Generative Adversial Network (GAN)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1406.2661.pdf) is a generative model using adversial approach. This model can be used to replicate content, such as cat/dog images. The adversial approach is inspired by the game theory, where two models, a generator and a critic, are competing with each other while making each other stronger at the same time.

The two models in `GAN` are generator and discriminator. The overview of the `GAN` is as below:
