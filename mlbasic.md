## Basics

### Hyperplane: 

In 'mathematics', a hyperplane H is a linear subspace of a vector space V such that the basis of H has cardinality one less than the cardinality of the basis for V.  In other words, if V is an n-dimensional vector space than H is an (n-1)-dimensional subspace.  

In 'machine learning', a hyperplane is a linear (often after transforming the space using a nonlinear kernel to lend a linear analysis) subspace that divides the data set into two regions for binary classification.  If the dimensionality of the data set is greater than 2, this may be performed multiple times to achieve a multi-way classification.

### Loss function:

Loss function/cost function is an (objective) function is used to define how bad a model does its job. An optimization problem tries to minimize the loss/cost. If the objective function is the negative of the loss/cost function, the function is called reward/utility function, in this case, we need to seek to maximize the reward/utility.
